# AT3Files
This repository contains the code for my AT3. It is required to run through Sonic Pi, however, I have included a .wav file containing an audio recording of my AT3 song.

Technologies used: Sonic Pi version 4.1.0

Setup: You should be able to copy and past the code in the .rb file directly into a new Sonic Pi session and then click play. I have included a .wav file of the song too.

Project Status: Complete

Achknowledgements: To David Conservatoire on Youtube for his Sonic Pi tutorials & Sam Aaron, creator of Sonic Pi for his tutorials.
